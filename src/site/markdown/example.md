## Sample Application

### About

The most important aim of the sample application is to provide Pivot4J users a working example to help them 
understand the API and use it to build their own pivot style OLAP application.
	
On the other hand, it was also intended to help developers of the project to examine the common use cases 
from end user's perspective and make them find out potential problems and improve upon the design.

We expect many part of the source code which is written for this sample application would eventually 
generalized and introduced to the Pivot4J project itself.
